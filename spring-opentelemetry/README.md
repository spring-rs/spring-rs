[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/spring-opentelemetry/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/spring-opentelemetry)

## Dependencies

```toml
spring-opentelemetry = "<version>"
```

OTEL uses the [W3C format](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context) to propagate context information for tracing by default.

Optional features:
* `jaeger`: Use [jaeger format](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.18/client-libraries/#propagation-format) to propagate context
* `zipkin`: Use [zipkin format](https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation) to propagate context
* `more-resource`: Add more resource information, such as host Host, operating system, process information

## Configuration

```toml
[opentelemetry]
enable = false    # Whether to enable the plugin at runtime
```

For other configurations, it is recommended to use the environment variables in the OTEL specification. For details, please refer to the OpenTelemetry SDK documentation:

* [SDK Configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/)
* [Environment Variable Specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/)

For complete code, refer to [`opentelemetry-example`](https://github.com/spring-rs/spring-rs/tree/master/examples/opentelemetry-example)

**Note**: [opentelemetry-rust](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust/issues/1678) is not stable yet, and some features of [tracing](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust/issues/1571) need to be integrated. The plugin will continue to track the relevant dynamics of opentelemetry-rust and tracing, and update them in a timely manner.
