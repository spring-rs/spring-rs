## A brief history of OpenTelemetry

* The [Dapper](https://research.google/pubs/dapper-a-large-scale-distributed-systems-tracing-infrastructure/) paper released by Google in 2010 marked the beginning of distributed link tracing.
* In 2012, Twitter open-sourced [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/).
* In 2015, Uber released the open-source version of [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/). Currently, Zipkin and Jaeger are still one of the most popular distributed link tracing tools.
* In 2015, the [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/) project was accepted by CNCF as its third hosted project, dedicated to standardizing distributed link tracing across components.
* In 2017, Google open-sourced its internal Census project, and then [OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) became popular in the community.
* In 2017, W3C started to develop [TraceContext](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context) related standards.
* In early 2019, two existing open source projects: OpenTracing and OpenCensus were announced to be merged into the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) project, and Log and Metrics were merged.
* In 2021, OpenTelemetry released V1.0.0, which provided stability guarantees for the client's link tracing part.
* 2023 is a milestone for OpenTelemetry, because its three basic signals, link tracing, metrics and logs, have all reached stable versions.
