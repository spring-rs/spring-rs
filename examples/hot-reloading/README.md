# Hot reloading example

This is just a example of how to use hot reloading with the `spring` framework. 
âœ¨


## For use:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus.git  dioxus-cli
```

This is temporal because the `dioxus-cli` is not yet published to crates.io.

```sh
dx serve --hot-patch --features hot-reload
```
